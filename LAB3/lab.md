CLUTTERING TASK
The task of grouping data points based on their similarity with each other is called Clustering or Cluster Analysis.

The various types of clustering are:

Hierarchical clustering
Partitioning clustering 
Hierarchical clustering is further subdivided into:

Agglomerative clustering
Divisive clustering
Partitioning clustering is further subdivided into:

K-Means clustering 
Fuzzy C-Means clustering
